/**
 * This class keeps a list of FMStations (specified by metadata key/value pairs)
 * and time indexes. While some other
 * media is playing (workout audio, for example), this class can associate
 * an FMStation with the current time index in the other media. When this class
 * is told of the current time index in the other media, it will map that
 * time index to an FMStation and then make sure that is the active station
 * in the FMAudioPlayer. If music is currently playing and the station is
 * changed, then the music from the old station will be crossfaded with the
 * new song in the new station.

 *
 * Setting the intial station to nil means the player starts out paused until a station switch
