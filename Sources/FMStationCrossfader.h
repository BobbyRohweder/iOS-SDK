/**
 * This class keeps a list of FMStations (specified by metadata key/value pairs)
 * and time indexes. While some other media is playing (workout audio, for example),
 * this class can switch different FMStations at specified cue points.
 * If music is currently playing and the station is changed, then the music from 
 * the old station will be crossfaded with the new song in the new station.
 *
 * The general pattern here is to create an instance of this class with the
 * cue points you care about:
 *
 * FMStationCrossfader *cf = [FMSTationCrossfade stationCrossfaderWithInitialStation:@{ @"bpm": @"slow" },
 *                                               andSwitches: @[
 *                                                      5.0f, @{ @"bpm": @"medium" },
 *                                                      10.0f, @{ @"bpm": @"high" }
 *                                               ]];
 *
 * then, just before starting your external media, call connect so this class
 * updates the global music player:
 *
 * [cf connect];
 *
 * then, as your external media elapses, inform the station crossfader:
 *
 * [cf elapseToTime: _externalMediaPlayer.currentElapsedTime]
 *
 * If the user pauses playback of music then call [cf disconnect] so that music
 * stays paused until the user turns it back on again. When the user wants to
 * resume playback, call [cf reconnect].
